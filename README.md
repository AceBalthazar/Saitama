## Welcome to this funky discord bot. 

I wrote this in node.js, using the discord.js library. this is just my 'development bot' that I use as a testing environment for various things, so some of the code will probably be garbage, some of it will be fragmented as hell, and you might see things that generally *don't make sense.*

If you have any questions or comments about this, contact me on discord or leave a comment in the repository. I'll check in when I can.
